# Derivative Trainer

This is a currently in progress derivative exercise generator.

The main reason I created this was for myself to get better and faster
at derivatives.

Currently the following is implemented:
- Power Rule
- Sum Rule

Currently in work are:
- Chain Rule
- Product Rule
- Quotient Rule

For this program to work you need to have a $\LaTeX$ compiler and Python 3
installed.

If you have any requests or suggestions feel free to hit me up sometime.
